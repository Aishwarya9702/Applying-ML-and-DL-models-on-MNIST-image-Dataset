# Applying ML and DL models on MNIST image Dataset
Using MNIST dataset due to its widespread use in evaluating classification algorithms. The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each of size 28×28 pixels. The data was preprocessed by normalizing pixel intensities to the [0,1] range and was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing using stratified sampling. Multiple models were trained and evaluated, including a Random Forest classifier, a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with performance measured using classification reports that include precision, recall, and F1-score
